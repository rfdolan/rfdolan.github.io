  <p>Icewind Dale lies North of the Spine of the World and West of the towering Reghed Glacier is a frigid expanse few dare to explore, let alone inhabit. This icy land of windswept tundra recently became locked in a perpetual, dark winter without reprieve. Auril the Frostmaiden, the divine embodiment of winter's fury, has withdrawn to this cold corner of the world to live among mortals. Further, she has cast a terrible spell over Icewind Dale, to the detriment of most of its denizens.</p>

  <p>Our adventure takes place here, in the Ten-Towns established four hundred years ago and inhabited by all manner of persons. Fishers, loggers, miners, hunters, trappers, furriers, traders, or anyone else for whom an isolated, cut-off region would make a good home. Plagued by Auril's curse, talking beasts, vile hags, and all other manner of creature, the already inhospitable area has become even deadlier in recent times. A vast, untamed, mysterious wilderness plagued by an evil force is the perfect place for a few adventurers with more than a few screws loose to claim treasure, glory, and power for themselves...</p>
