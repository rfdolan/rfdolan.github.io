        <h3>Creating This Blog</h3>
        <p>
          I've been working on many things lately while I seek a new job. So many things
          in fact, that I figured it would be fun to collect them all here in a blog!
          I plan to update the blog weekly on <b>Fridays</b> and cover:
        <ul>
          <li>Software development</li>
          <li>Hobby electronics development</li>
          <li>Miscellaneous personal projects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All of this is mostly to give a window into what I'm up to and to keep myself motivated to make
          progress on my various projects!
        </p>

        <h3>Soldering</h3>
        <p>
          Last year I came into posession of a soldering iron, a 60W Weller. It works great except for the
          fact that it's missing its stand, and I haven't been able to get a hold of Weller support to get a replacement.

          which was a great opportunity to practice my soldering and set up the station. A simple Amazon fan
          pulling the fumes
          away did wonders, I finished it very quick!

          It came out very nicely, although I did solder the red keys where the black keys should've been,
          requiring me to get
          well acquainted with removing solder. That wasn't the end of the world though, since my other
          soldering projects involve
          removing some really stubborn stuck-on solder. Desoldering wick is now my best friend.

        <h3>GBC Power Switch Repair</h3>
        <p>
          I've had an old GameBoy Color since I was about 10 years old. I bought it at a yard sale but it was
          never able to power on. After doing some research I used my multimeter and was able to determine that the issue was
          probably that the power
          switch wasn't working. From there, I desoldered the bits keeping the power switch in place (which
          were quite stubborn)
          and removed the panel.
          </p>
          
        <div class="horizontal-list">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <img src="images/blog/1/gbc-disassembled.jpg" alt="The disassembled power switch for the GameBoy Color. Much simpler in operation than I was expecting." />

            </li>
          </ul>
        </div> 
          <p>
          Then it was a simple matter of cleaning off the switch and switch surface
          with some isopropyl
          alcohol, waiting for the to dry, and reassembling the whole thing. To my surprise, this was enough
          to get the thing to
          power on! I'm quite thankful nothing more serious was wrong.
        </p>
        <div class="horizontal-list">

        </div>
        <p>
          None of the buttons worked, so I'm going to have to go back and see about cleaning off / repairing
          the contacts for
          those. A project for another week, as I'm worried about stripping the screws that hold the board to
          the plastic case
          from unscrewing it too many times (I should really invest in a ton of screws of different sizes...)
        </p>
        
        <h3>Laptop CMOS Battery Replacement</h3>
        <p>
          My laptop, a Lenovo ThinkPad Carbon, had a problem: every time it ran out of battery completely and was recharged, it
          beeped extremely loud when powering back on. It took me a little while to figure out the issue, since all I saw was it
          screaming about date and time settings. After some research I realized the small CMOS battery attached to the
          motherboard had probably died, so the computer way really dying all the way every time the main battery was drained.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there I got the new battery, unscrewed the laptop, and replaced the battery. I'd been intimidated by the idea of
          laptop repair before, but looking at it here I could tell it's just a very specialized computer, so finding the
          battery and replacing it was a breeze. Now the laptop powers on without beeping extremely loud!
        </p>

      <h3>Bike Repairs</h3>
      <p>
        I crashed my bike back in December. My injuries weren't too bad, see the spoilered images below if you're curious.
      </p>
      <div class="horizontal-list">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <div class="spoiler">

              </div>
              <p>The scrape on my arm.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="spoiler">
                <button class="spoiler-button" onclick="unspoiler(this)"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/?size=100&id=60022&format=png&color=000000"></button>

              </div>
              <p>The scrape on my shin.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>
        The worst part of the whole thing was that I broke two parts on the bike:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The left pedal</li>
        <li>The front shifter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The front shifter had seemed fine, but the second I tried to shift up there was a little *tink!* and the knob sheared
        off.
      </p>
      <div class="horizontal-list">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <img src="images/blog/1/bike-shift-knob-broke.jpg" alt="The shift knob of the bike that broke off, and the spot it broke off of." />
            <p>The shift knob of the bike that broke off, and the spot it broke off of.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        So two pieces of maintenance, not too crazy. Replacing the pedals was easy, just unscrew the old ones and screw on
        the new. Easy peasey! I'm not sure if I love the new pedals, they're quite large and mountain-bike-esque, where my
        bike is a hybrid leaning more road (although I've still got flat pedals).
      </p>
      <div class="horizontal-list">

            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      <p>
        The shifter was more intimidating: wires, the brake line, and the rest of the handlebar assembly to contend with… It
        ended up being a lot easier that I expected! Removing the grip was the hardest part, got some rubbing alcohol inside
        and slowly worked it off. This made me realize the bar end caps should probably also get replaced, since the one on
        the left got pretty scraped up. From there though, I just had to unscrew the brake line, undo the shifter cable, pull
        it through, then reattach everything on the new shifter.
      </p>
      <div class="horizontal-list">
          <ul>

              <p>The old shifter, disassembled after I managed the get the wire out. Kinda cool to see the ratcheting mechanism that makes it all tick.</p>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      <p>
        Since I already know how to adjust the brakes and 
        index the gears, it was pretty easy from here. Felt good to do all this myself, I understand my machine quite well
        now.
      </p>
       <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        I'm planning to begin developing for the Raspberry Pi soon, I've got two lying around and it would be nice to write
        and OS for them to really flex my OS development skills. As I work on transition from games to more complex systems
        development a project like this will go a long way to show off my adaptability and general software delivery skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, finishing my fixes for the GameBoy Color (the buttons) and fixing a handheld video poker machine I have
        lying around are other things on my radar.
