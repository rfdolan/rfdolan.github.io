    <h1>Blossom</h1>
    <p>Blossom is a game where you play as a small flower person and seing through levels, collecting "dawndrops" to 
        revive a sacred flower.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Programming the movement of the character while grappling.</li>
        <li>Developing the visualization of the grappling rope.</li>
        <li>Composing and recording the music.</li>
        <li>Creating particle effects for floating, grappling, and landing. </li>
        <li>Scripting back-and-forth movement of bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>One challenge came with figuring out how to program the grappling. I couldn't find any built-in ways to attach
        two actors dynamically so I used vectors and math to create teh swinging effect, which took some time. The final
        math looked like this and is called every frame.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
    if(isGrappling) {
        FVector PlayerPos = GetActorLocation();
        FVector GrapplePoint = CurrentlyGrappled->GetActorLocation();
        FVector dif = PlayerPos-GrapplePoint;
        float dist = dif.Size();
        float dot = vel.DotProduct(vel,dif);
        dif.Normalize();

        // If we are on a bug and go past max range, snap us back into place
        if(dist> 600) {
            FVector newLoc = GrapplePoint +(dif * 600);
            SetActorLocation(newLoc);
        }
        dif = dif * dot * -2;
        GetCharacterMovement()->AddForce(dif);
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Another thing that took a while was fixing the grappling rope. It was easy to attach to points, but I 
        ran into trouble trying to detach it, as it would either not detach or attach to different things. It took
        a very long time to fix that bug. It turned out that there was an initial setting I had set, EnableCollisions, 
        which was causing the error. Disabling this fixed the issue. Here is the final initialization of the Cable.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
    // Create a cable component to act as the grappling rope
	Cable = CreateDefaultSubobject&ltUCableComponent&gt(TEXT("Cable"));
	Cable->EndLocation = FVector(0,0,0);
	Cable->NumSegments = 20;
	Cable->SolverIterations = 16;
	Cable->SubstepTime = 0.005;
	Cable->bEnableStiffness = true;
	// Cable->bEnableCollision = true;
	Cable->CollisionFriction = 1.0;
	Cable->CableGravityScale = 1.2;
	Cable->CableWidth = 3;
	Cable->NumSides = 10;
	Cable->CableLength = 1.f;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>Here is a diagram of the two most important classes for grappling. The game mode manages a list of grapple points
        and can give them to the BlossomCharacter. The character will populate the "CurrentlyGrappled" field and flip the 
        "isGrappling" bool when the player does a valid grapple.

    <h2>Version Control</h2>
    <p>For this project we used Perforce. None of us had ever used Perforce before, so it was a learning experience for all.</p>
    <p>Which was of course, very stressful.</p>
    <p>In the beginning, I lost a couple files while using Perforce and had to redo them. A lot of issues came from 
        files either not being added or not beign pulled. A group member would say "oh, X isn't working" and 99% of the 
        time it was because they hadn't pulled. Very frustrating. I do think that Perforce was better than git for this 
        type of project because the checking out files protected against major errors once we knew how to use it.
    </p>

    <h2>Lessons</h2>
    <p>From this project I have learned a couple lessons.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Don't randomly apply settings without knowing what they do and if you'll need them. If I had payed closer 
            attention to the settings I was using with the Cable compoennt, I wouls have more easily been able to track
            down which one was causing the bug.
        </li>
        <li>Make sure everyone is on the same page with how to use version control. In the beginning of learning how to 
            use Perforce, we were all still learning it and I ended up losing a couple files because I wasn't sure what
            was happening. Back up files until you're sure you won't lose them (I literally just copied my .cpp files into
            text files until I was comfortable with Perforce).
        </li>
        <li>Communication is key. Every group project I do just hammers home this lesson. Any time group members were hard
            to get a hold of or didn't communicate what they were doing with the version control, bad things happened. 
            Sometimes it's out of your control but good communication from everyone is very important.
        </li>
        <li>Online learning is weird. This project was developed entirely remotely during April-May 2020 as a result of 
            the Covid-19 outbreak. It was an interesting format and honestly it made regular meetings easier since nobody
            had to travel anywhere to meet. Still, it was strange, and it was hard to lean over people's shoulders and 
            look at their code.
        </li>


    </ol>
